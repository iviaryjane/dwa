Engineer by day, creative spirit by night.<br>

Mary Jane Maldonado, originally from sunny San Antonio, TX moved to Boston, MA
in pursuit of new exciting experiences.  She is a 2009 graduate from the University of Texas
at San Antonio in Electrical and Computer Engineering.  Although with a very technical
degree, there has always been a creative fire burning inside.  Growing up in a family owned 
picture frame shop surrounded her with constant contemporary art by local artists.
Photography, fashion design, and being crafty were her creative outlets of choice.  Also
interested in science and technology, Mary Jane became very involved in programming and robotics.
Wanting a technical challenge and to work hands on, she chose to pursue
engineering. After college, she obtained an exciting job at Raytheon and currently still
holds this position.  She is a firm believer that life is not about finding yourself, but 
about creating yourself. Today, she looks to expand her horizons by taking this Web 
Development course for fun and personal growth. Hoping to one day professionally collide 
aesthetics and logic. <br>
